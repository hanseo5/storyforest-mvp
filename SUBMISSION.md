# Gemini 3 Hackathon Submission Materials

## 📝 Project Details for Devpost

### Project Name
**Storyforest - Magical AI Storybook Creator**

### Tagline
Create personalized, illustrated children's stories in seconds using Gemini 3 & AI Voice.

### ✍️ Description (approx. 200 words)
**Storyforest** reimagines bedtime stories by empowering parents and children to co-create personalized picture books instantly. Powered by Google's **Gemini 3 API** (`gemini-3.0-flash`), the application transforms simple prompts or child-centric inputs (like "a brave dinosaur who loves pizza") into fully realized stories with rich character development and emotional depth.

We leverage Gemini 3's advanced multimodal capabilities for the entire creative pipeline:
1.  **Story Generation:** Gemini 3 writes professionally structured 12-page narratives, ensuring age-appropriate language and meaningful morals.
2.  **Character Persona Engineering:** It deepens flat character concepts into "living" personas with unique quirks and sensory details.
3.  **Visual Direction:** We use Gemini 3 to generate precise, style-consistent image prompts for each page, maintaining visual continuity across the book.
4.  **Translation:** It provides instant, culturally nuanced translations in English, Korean, and Japanese, preserving the poetic tone of the original story.

By combining Gemini 3's speed and quality with **ElevenLabs** for voice synthesis, Storyforest offers a complete read-along experience, making every night's story time a unique adventure.
